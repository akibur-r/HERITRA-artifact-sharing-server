## <p style="color: #b89c72">About</p>

Heritra is a full-stack web application where people can explore and share information about historical artifacts. Users can view artifact details, add their own entries, like artifacts, and see what they’ve contributed.

### <p style="color: #b89c72">Purpose</p>

The application is built in response of the need to create a simple and accessible platform for exploring and managing historical artifacts. It allows users to view detailed information about artifacts, contribute their own entries, and keep track of what they’ve added. The goal is to make artifact sharing more organized, interactive, and easy for anyone interested in history.

- Once a user deletes an artifact, all the likes from all users are removed.
- The upload time in artifact details page is displayed relative to current time.
